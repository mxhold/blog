    <p>As someone new(ish) to professional programming, it is nice to work in a field
where your formal qualifications are pretty much irrelevant if you can prove
that you can do the job.</p>

<p>This is frequently done by contributing to open-source software. Your GitHub
profile can be more important than your résumé when it comes to landing a job.</p>

<p>But it can be hard to know where to start.</p>

<h3 id="gardening">Gardening</h3>

<p>There is a lot of advice out there on how to approach contributing to OSS.</p>

<p>Steve Klabnik offers some good advice about <a href="http://words.steveklabnik.com/how-to-be-an-open-source-gardener">how to be an open source
gardener</a>.</p>

<p>He says large open-source projects are like gardens that have weeds (issues)
that need to be tended regularly.
He took up tending to the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails">Rails</a> garden by
triaging a massive number of issues.</p>

<p>Steve gets all the kudos I can offer.</p>

<p>I’ve tried my hand at looking through some Rails issues because, of course, I
want to be cool like Steve Klabnik.
I’ll just say a lot of those issues are posted by people who seem to know what
they’re doing.</p>

<p>I don’t know what I’m doing.</p>

<p>So in order to be cool and contribute to OSS, I channelled my earliest days as a
developer (about a year ago) and I did what I did then:</p>

<p>I found a problem and tried to solve it by copying code written by someone who
knew what they were doing.</p>

<h3 id="arel-is-awesome">Arel is Awesome</h3>

<p>A few weeks ago, I was looking into <a href="https://github.com/rails/arel">Arel</a> (which
has totally changed the way I use Rails by the way, def would recommend).</p>

<p>Arel makes it easier to write complex SQL queries without having to build big
strings of raw SQL.
Instead you can just use Ruby.</p>

<p>Something like:</p>

<pre class="highlight sql"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">snacks</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">snacks</span>
<span class="k">INNER</span> <span class="k">JOIN</span> <span class="n">maxs_favorite_snacks</span>
<span class="k">ON</span> <span class="n">snacks</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">maxs_favorite_snacks</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">snack_id</span>
<span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">snacks</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">vegetarian</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="n">snacks</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">deep_fried</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>becomes:</p>

<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">snacks</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Arel</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Table</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:snacks</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">maxs_favorite_snacks</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Arel</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Table</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:maxs_favorite_snacks</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">snacks</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">project</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">snacks</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">Arel</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">star</span><span class="p">])</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">maxs_favorite_snacks</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">on</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">snacks</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:id</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">maxs_favorite_snacks</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:snack_id</span><span class="p">]))</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">snacks</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:vegetarian</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">and</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">snacks</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:deep_fried</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)))</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">to_sql</span>
</code></pre>

<p>What it lacks in readability it makes up for in composability.</p>

<p>For example, the above methods (<code>project</code>, <code>join</code>, <code>where</code>) could have been
called in any order since the SQL is only generated once at the end.</p>

<h3 id="visitors-and-nodes">Visitors and Nodes</h3>

<p>Anyway, I was looking around the repo to try to figure out where all the magic
happened because that seems like quite a feat.</p>

<p>I figured this thing is generating SQL so there must be a bunch of strings
somewhere like “INNER JOIN” and “SELECT”.</p>

<p>I clicked around a bit and found a <code>nodes</code> directory with a bunch of classes
including <code>inner_join.rb</code> and <code>select_statement.rb</code>.
Woo! That must be it.</p>

<p>But they seemed pretty abstract when I looked at them:</p>

<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="c1"># arel/lib/arel/nodes/inner_join.rb</span>
<span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Arel</span>
  <span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Nodes</span>
    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">InnerJoin</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Arel</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Nodes</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Join</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Hmm… my strings must be in another castle.</p>

<p>Soon enough I discovered the <code>visitors</code> directory and a file called <code>to_sql.rb</code>
which starts with a bunch of constants:</p>

<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="no">WHERE</span>    <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">' WHERE '</span>
<span class="no">SPACE</span>    <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">' '</span>
<span class="no">COMMA</span>    <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">', '</span>
<span class="no">GROUP_BY</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">' GROUP BY '</span>
<span class="no">ORDER_BY</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">' ORDER BY '</span>
<span class="no">WINDOW</span>   <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">' WINDOW '</span>
<span class="no">AND</span>      <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">' AND '</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Jackpot!</p>

<p>It turns out Arel uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">visitor design
pattern</a>, which is pretty neat if
you aren’t familiar with it (I wasn’t).</p>

<p>My (pretty basic) understanding of it is that it means you can use Arel to build
up a tree of Arel::Nodes that represent the SQL thing you’re trying to do and
then a visitor visits each node and figures out what to do for each node.</p>

<p>Looking at the other files in the <code>visitors</code> directory makes that make a little
more sense as there are database-specific visitors that implement things that
only exist for that database, like <code>ILIKE</code> for Postgres.</p>

<p>There is even a visitor for generating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language\)">DOT
file</a> instead
of SQL!
I imagine that would be crazy gross to add if they didn’t use this pattern.</p>

<p>Anyway, I took a peek at the <code>postgres.rb</code> visitor:</p>

<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Arel</span>
  <span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Visitors</span>
    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">PostgreSQL</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Arel</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Visitors</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">ToSql</span>

      <span class="k">end</span>

      <span class="k">end</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Then I thought: “Oh cool! I didn’t know I could use Arel to generate a <code>DISTINCT
ON</code> query.”</p>

<p>And that’s where I left it until a week later I was writing a query for a Rails
app using Arel, and thought I needed to use a <code>DISTINCT ON</code>.</p>

<h3 id="is-this-a-bug-or-am-i-just-dumb">Is This a Bug or Am I Just Dumb?</h3>

<p>I checked the README to see if it mentioned how to use it… no dice.</p>

<p>You can tack a <code>distinct</code> on the end but that just gives you a normal distinct:</p>

<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">snacks</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">project</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">snacks</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">Arel</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">star</span><span class="p">]).</span><span class="nf">distinct</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">to_sql</span>
<span class="c1"># =&gt; "SELECT DISTINCT \"snacks\".* FROM \"snacks\""</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Well, I thought, the <code>DISTINCT ON</code> is just another kind of node… maybe I can
just stick it in the select and Arel would figure it out and everything would be
ok:</p>

<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="no">Country</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">select</span><span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="no">Arel</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Nodes</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">DistinctOn</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="no">Country</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">arel_table</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:id</span><span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">select</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">Arel</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">star</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">to_sql</span>
<span class="c1"># =&gt; "SELECT DISTINCT ON ( \"countries\".\"id\" ), * FROM \"countries\""</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Hmm looks kinda reasonable… but then I ran it:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>PG::Error: ERROR:  syntax error at or near ","
LINE 1: SELECT DISTINCT ON ( "countries"."id" ), * FROM "countries"
                                               ^
</code></pre>

<p>Womp womp.
Either this is a bug or I didn’t know how to use <code>Arel::Nodes::DistinctOn</code>.</p>

<p>I filed <a href="https://github.com/rails/arel/issues/302">an issue</a> and went on my way.</p>

<p>It turns out I didn’t need a <code>DISTINCT ON</code> in my query anyway so I kinda forgot
about it.</p>

<p>But I came back to it a couple weeks later… no one had responded to the issue
so I thought I’d take a crack at it.
I mean, how hard could it be to just make that comma not happen?</p>

<h3 id="making-that-comma-not-happen">Making that Comma Not Happen</h3>

<p>I tracked down <a href="https://github.com/rails/arel/blob/fef9ce493ec3eab3cf120550abd0257f89eaddf7/lib/arel/visitors/to_sql.rb#L247">the part of the code that was adding the
comma</a>
and realized it was basically treating the <code>DISTINCT ON</code> node like another
column, rather than as a modification of the entire select.</p>

<p>So yeah… I was doing it wrong.</p>

<p>Well there must be <em>some</em> way to do it, otherwise why would the node exist??</p>

<p>I checked <a href="https://github.com/rails/arel/commit/0b9af9762a5f3431f83a9bba6919fef9346e310a">the
commit</a>
that introduced the <code>visit_Arel_Nodes_DistinctOn</code> method to the Postgres
visitor.</p>

<p>Hmm… well there was a test so it must work… but it requires you to create
the <code>Arel::Nodes::SelectCore</code> yourself, which seemed gross to me.</p>

<p>It should be just as easy as using <code>distinct</code>!</p>

<p>You should be able to just do:</p>

<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">table</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Arel</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Table</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:users</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">table</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">project</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">Arel</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">star</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">distinct_on</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">table</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:id</span><span class="p">]).</span><span class="nf">to_sql</span>
<span class="c1"># =&gt; "SELECT DISTINCT ON ( \"users\".\"id\" ) * FROM \"users\""</span>
</code></pre>

<p>It was up to me to fix this and restore balance to the universe and ~contribute
to OSS~!</p>

<p>I looked at how <code>distinct</code> worked, copied the tests for <code>distinct</code>, replaced
<code>Arel::Nodes::Distinct</code> with <code>Arel::Nodes::DistinctOn</code>, and added some stuff so
you could give it an argument (since we have to <code>DISTINCT ON</code> something).</p>

<p>I made the tests pass by copying the <code>distinct</code> method and adding some stuff to
give it an argument.</p>

<p>Then I made <a href="https://github.com/rails/arel/pull/306">my first pull request</a>(!)
and waited.</p>

<p>Some days later and it got merged!</p>

<h3 id="success">Success!</h3>

<p>Finally all the copy-pasting practice I’ve gained from StackOverflow over the
years has paid off.</p>

<p>I think this is a good example of how new developers can benefit a lot from
well-written, existing code in a project.</p>

<p>My super basic contribution to open source software also showed me that the
libraries I use day-to-day that seem super magical can actually be pretty
accessible if you dig into them.</p>

<p>Now I feel less like I don’t know what I’m doing.</p>
