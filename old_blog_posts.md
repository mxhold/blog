Here are a few blog posts I wrote in the past:

- 2015 June 4 - [Build a Blog with Phoenix and Ember.js](/blog/build-a-blog-with-phoenix-and-ember/) (very outdated)
- 2015 May 19 - [Rails Migration Checklist](/blog/rails-migration-checklist/) (semi-outdated and I don't currently agree with all my recommendations)
- 2014 Sep 29 - [Contributing to Open Source using Copy and Paste](/blog/contributing-to-open-source-with-copy-paste/) (semi-outdated, semi-cringe-inducing writing)
