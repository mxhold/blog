title: Syntax Test

I made this post to test my blog's ability to do syntax highlighting.

Here's some Ruby:

```ruby
class Foo
  def bar(arg)
    puts "hello #{arg}"
  end
end
```

Here's some Elixir:

```elixir
defmodule Foo do
  def bar(arg) do
    IO.puts "hello #{arg}"
  end
end
```

Here's some Rust:

```rust
mod foo {
  pub fn bar(arg: String) {
    println!("hello {}", arg);
  }
}
```
